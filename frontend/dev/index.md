# Developing Frontend

A Cadmus frontend app can be as simple as a simple Angular app using some Cadmus libraries, or add its own parts and/or fragments, or any other component useful for its purposes.

The typical procedure to setup a Cadmus frontend app consists of:

1. [create the app](app-setup).
2. add to the app all the required NPM packages and code resources.
3. optionally, add specific [parts](app-parts) and/or [fragments](app-fragments) packed into [libraries](app-lib) in the same workspace.
